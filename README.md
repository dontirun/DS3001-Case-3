## Description

## Building
This project requires the following packages:
* `gym`: Install with `pip install gym[all]`
* `matplotlib`: Install with `pip install matplotlib`
* `pybrain`: Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/pybrain/pybrain/wiki/Installation) to install
* `numpy`: Install with `pip install numpy`

## Execution
The notebook [case3.ipynb](case3.ipynb) can be executed top to bottom to produce our results and visualizations.
